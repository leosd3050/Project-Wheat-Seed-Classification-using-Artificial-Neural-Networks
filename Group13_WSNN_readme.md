### Objective  : --
Measurements of geometrical properties of kernels belonging to three different varieties of
wheat. It has 210 data points each with 7 attributes, and 3 classes (1,2,3) denoting three
different varieties of wheat. In this assignment, you will implement some simple multi-layer
perceptrons and neural networks.


## Files :--
| File Name | File Description |
|-----------|------------------|
| Group13_WSNN *(notebook)*   | [Group13_WSNN.ipynb](Group13_WSNN.ipynb)   This file have the code to solve the problem in the given way like one is to solve the problem by using ANN of one inner layer, ANN of 2 inner layer and pretrained model of both the types.|
| Group13_WSNN *(report)*   | [Group13_WSNN.ipynb](Group13_WSNN.ipynb)   This file have the code to solve the problem in the given way   | [Group13_WSNN.pdf](Group13_WSNN.pdf) This file consist of description of the different functions present in the ipynb notebook and how the program should be run. Also, we have mentioned the various accuracies obtained for the different implementations of the neural networks.

The different function definitions can be consulted from the *Group13_WSNN.pdf* report file. Initially, we need to upload the *seeds_dataset.txt* file (under *sample_data* on Google Colab)and then we can safely run all the code cells at once by clicking on *Runtime -> Run all*. The required plots, accuracies, etc will be generated.
